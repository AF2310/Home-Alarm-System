# Home-Alarm-System
Project Description

For this project we are creating a security alarm device that ththough various ways detects motion when activated remotely or by a tilt switch and triggers an alarm and notifies the house owner of the detected inruder via a message. The device utilizes a bread board, a pico w microcontroller several complementary sensors such as a PIR sensor,hall effect digital sensor ,a passive buzzer and a tilt switch. Furthermore for data visualization Adafruit will be used  and to publish data to Adafruit using the arduino MQTT libray will. Finally for connectivity wifi will be used and for notifying the house owner via Adafruit fruit the application known as discord will be used.
