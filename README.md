**Project Description**
****


For this project we are creating a security alarm device that through various ways detects motion when activated remotely or by a tilt switch and triggers an alarm and notifies the house owner of the detected inruder via a message. 

The device utilizes a bread board, a pico w microcontroller several complementary sensors such as a PIR sensor,hall effect digital sensor ,a passive buzzer and a tilt switch. 

Furthermore for data visualization Adafruit will be used and to publish data to Adafruit the arduino MQTT libray will be used. 

Finally for connectivity wifi will be used and for notifying the house owner via Adafruit actions using a webhook the application known as discord will be used.

Also the IDE known as thonny will be utilized and the scource code with be in micropython.

Estimated time: 20-25 hours if all materials are already available and no prior iot experience.

**Objective**
****

The main motivation behind this project is testing and combining various easily available sensors as well as creating a home utility device.

Through remote activation i can set up the alarm device for my flat room or the main entrance to the building and be notified via discord message of any intrusion and call the police in time.

In case iam able to further incorporate the arducam OV7675 in this project i may be able to capture images of any dected home intrusion as well.
